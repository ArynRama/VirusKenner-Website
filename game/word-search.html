				<p class="defs" id="def_Immunodeficiency">Inability to produce  an adequate immune response because of an insufficiency or absence of antibodies, immune cells or both. Hiv is an immunodeficiency disorder that can be transmitted through sexual contact, illicit injection drug use or  shairng needles , contact with infected blood or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.</p>
				<p class="defs" id="def_Infection">Having HIV weakens your body's immune system, it destroys white blood cells that fight infection, because of this it puts the person at risk for opportunistic infections(OIs). These are serious infections that take advantage of your weak immune system.</p>
				<p class="defs" id="def_Transmission">The process of passing something  from one person or place to another. HIV can be transmitted through sexual contact, illicit injection drug use or  shairng needles , contact with infected blood or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.</p>
				<p class="defs" id="def_Immunesystem">Immune system is the body's natural defense system. it's a network of cells, tissues and organs inside the body, it also recognizes and fights off germs. HIV weakens the immune system , which means that common germs can cause infections and illnesses.</p>
				<p class="defs" id="def_Vaginalfluids">Vaginal fluid is one of the body fluids of a woman where HIV is found If she has HIV and a detectable viral load.</p>
				<p class="defs" id="def_Macrophages">Macrophages are important target cells for Acute HIV infection, also known as the 1st stage of HIV. They are key players in the innate immune response(nonspecific immune system) to pathogens and are recruited to sites of infection and inflammation.</p>
				<p class="defs" id="def_Intercourse">Another word for sex.</p>
				<p class="defs" id="def_Semen">Semen  is one of the body fluids of a man where HIV is found if he has HIV and a detectable viral load. If his semen gets into the body of his sexual partner during sex, HIV can get into the others persons bloodstream.</p>
				<p class="defs" id="def_Antibody">Antibody, also called immunoglobulin,  is a protective protein produced by the immune system in response to the presence of a foreign substance, called an antigen. These antibodies recognize and latch into antigens in order to remove them from the body. Antibodies have the potential to block HIV-1 replication through multiple pathways and they exert immune pressure on the virus that leads to escape.</p>
				<p class="defs" id="def_Syringe">Not cleaning used syringes or not using new syringes  is one of the ways that HIV can be transmitted. HIV can survive 42 days in a used syringe , but this also depends on the temperature and other factors.</p>
				<p class="defs" id="def_Breastmilk">Breastfeeding contributes to the risk of perinatal HIV infection. Infants born to HIV-positive women can get HIV orally by ingesting their mothers breast milk which may contain virus particles.</p>
				<p class="defs" id="def_Blood">Exposure to blood that contains HIV is one of the highest risks of getting HIV, because blood can carry more of the virus that other bodily fluids.</p>
				<p class="defs" id="def_Sex">One of the most common ways HIV can be transmitted is through anal or vaginal sex.</p>
				<p class="defs" id="def_Condom">Using condoms every time you have sex is one of the ways to prevent HIV.</p>
				<p class="defs" id="def_tcells">Also called CD4 cells and are white blood cells that are critical to the immune system. They are responsible for keeping people healthy and protecting them from common diseases. HIV attacks these specific immune system cells in the body which makes it harder for the body to fight off other infections.</p>
				<p class="defs" id="def_Prep">PrEP stands for Pre-exposure prophylaxis. With this strategy , people  at an increased risk for getting or transmitting HIV use daily medication in pill form to help prevent HIV transmission, It can stop HIV from taking hold and spreading throughout the body.</p>
				<p class="defs" id="def_Aids">Aids stands for Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. This is a condition that results in serious damage to the immune system and is the 3th and advanced stage of HIV.</p>
				<p class="defs" id="def_Injection">Sharing drug injection equipment puts people at risk for getting or transmitting HIV. The risk is very high if a HIV-negative person uses injection equipment that someone with HIV has used, because it may have blood in it. But you also have injectable HIV , which is a way to prevent or treat HIV.</p>
				<p class="defs" id="def_Measures">Meaning ways to prevent HIV.</p>
				<p class="defs" id="def_Undetectable">Undetectable is a term that is used to refer to a viral load that's so low that tests can't detect it, However an undetectable viral load doesn't mean that person no longer has HIV.</p>
				<p class="defs" id="def_Viralload">Viral load is the amount of HIV measured in volume of blood. By measuring the viral load people can tell  how well their medication is working.</p>
				<p class="defs" id="def_Pep">PEP stands for post-exposure prophylaxis. It is an emergency treatment where  people who may have been exposed to HIV take a combination of pills within 72 hours of possible exposure so that they can reduce their risk for contracting the virus.</p>
